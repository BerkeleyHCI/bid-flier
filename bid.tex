The Berkeley Institute of Design (BiD) is a research group that fosters a new and deeply interdisciplinary approach to design for the 21st century.  We are an active research group with a focus that spans human-computer interaction (HCI), mechanical design, education, architecture, and art practice.\\

\subsection{Sauron: Embedded Single-Camera Sensing of Printed Physical User Interfaces}
\emph{Valkyrie Savage, valkyrie@eecs.berkeley.edu}\\

3D printers enable designers to rapidly produce models of future products.  Today these physical prototypes are mostly \emph{passive}.  Our goal is to enable designers to turn models produced on commodity 3D printers into interactive objects with minimal assembly or instrumentation.  We present Sauron, an embedded machine vision-based system for sensing human input on physical controls like buttons, sliders, and joysticks.  Sauron automatically modifies the interior geometry of a designer's object so that, when printed, all components can be sensed by adding a single inward-pointing camera.
